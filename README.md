# OpenGL GLFW stb Programming Example

`template-stb` is a collection of straightforward examples that demonstrate the use of the `stb` library, focusing on its `stb_image.h` and `stb_truetype.h`
modules. This project is built upon [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), aiming to provide an easy and understandable abstraction layer for
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/).
