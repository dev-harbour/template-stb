<br />

`hbgl` is a lightweight and flexible library, designed to be simple and easy to use as an immediate mode GUI. Built on top of [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/),
it's designed to offer a simple layer of abstraction over [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), allowing developers to focus on
creating content rather than dealing with the intricacies of OpenGL. This project makes use of the single-file [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
public domain libraries by Sean Barrett.
